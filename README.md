Core Features
Drill Sergeant Mode
Vicious Persona: The app's tone is harsh. Failure is not optional.

Harsh Penalties: Compliance penalties are steep (20% per failure), and forfeit durations start long (15 min) and only get longer.

Dynamic Task System
Random & Scheduled Tasks: Get random tasks (chores, exercise, etc.) assigned throughout your "active hours." You can also schedule specific tasks for specific days of the week.

Time Pressure: All tasks have a customizable timer (default 2 hours). Failure to complete the task in time is an automatic failure.

Scaling Difficulty:

Level Up: Complete a task 3 times in a row, and it "levels up," permanently increasing its reps/duration by 10%.

Level Down: Fail a task, and its difficulty is reduced by 10% for next time.

"Speed Run" Bonus: Complete a task in the first 25% of its allotted time to earn a 1.5x points bonus.

Procrastination Penalty: The longer you wait, the harder it gets. For tasks with reps/time, the required amount will scale up from 1.0x to 2.0x as the timer runs out.

Vicious Forfeit System
Punishment for Failure: Failing a task (by timer) assigns you a random forfeit (e.g., "Face the corner" + "Hands in air").

Compounding Duration: Forfeits have their own timer. If you don't complete it in time, the timer runs into the negative, and the total required duration increases by the base amount for every hour you are overdue. There is no maximum.

Escalating Penalties: Every time you complete a forfeit, its base duration permanently increases by 10%.

Compliance Penalties:

<= 50% Compliance: All forfeit durations are DOUBLED.

<= 25% Compliance: You are assigned TWO forfeits back-to-back.

Economy & Motivation
Reward Shop: Earn points for tasks and spend them on custom rewards in the shop.

Shop Lock: The shop is LOCKED if your compliance is 50% or below.

Debt & Lockdown:

Can't afford a reward? You can borrow it once. This puts you into debt.

While in DEBT LOCKDOWN, you are working for free. All task points are applied directly to your debt until it is paid.

A 1% compounding hourly interest is applied to your debt.

Tasks are assigned continuously during active hours until your debt is paid.

Skip Passes: Earn one "Skip Pass" for every 20 completed tasks.

Use a pass to skip a task with no penalty.

Use a pass to halve the current duration of an active forfeit.

Daily Streaks & Badges:

A Streak Counter (🔥) tracks your consecutive days of task completion.

Maintain 100% compliance for 7 days to earn the "Perfect Week" (🎖️) badge. It disappears the moment you fail.

Stats & Security
Failure Log: When you fail a task, you must log why ("Forgot," "Too difficult," or "I refused").

Stats Tab: A dedicated tab shows you graphs of your failure reasons and which tasks you fail most often.

Settings Lock: You can lock all settings (tasks, rewards, schedules) to prevent your weaker self from cheating.askMaster: The Drill Sergeant
