TaskMaster: Your Life, Gamified.
​TaskMaster is a standalone, browser-based application for adults who want to introduce serious accountability and gamified discipline into their lives. Inspired by popular productivity and accountability apps like cornertimeio, this tool turns your daily responsibilities into a game where the stakes are real and the rewards are earned.
​You set the rules. You define the tasks. You choose the rewards. Then, you submit to the system you created.
​Who is it for?
​Adults seeking powerful motivation to complete chores, workouts, and personal growth goals.
​Individuals who thrive on structure, rules, and clear consequences.
​Anyone looking to explore self-discipline through a challenging and rewarding system.
​Users who want a highly customizable experience they can tailor to their exact needs and limits.
​Key Features:
​🎲 Unpredictable Daily Challenges: Receive randomly assigned tasks from your personalized lists, keeping your routine fresh and exciting. A 24-hour countdown clock ensures you stay on track.
​🏆 Earnable Rewards & Point Economy: Don't just check a box—earn it. Completing tasks rewards you with points, which you can spend on custom rewards like "Watch a Movie" or "Have some me time." You control the cost and the reward.
​⛓️ Robust Forfeit System: Failure isn't the end; it's a new beginning. Failing to complete a task within the time limit results in a randomly generated forfeit. Each forfeit is a unique combination of a Task (e.g., "Face the corner"), a Position (e.g., "Hands in air"), and a Duration.
​🧠 Adaptive Difficulty: The app learns from you. After completing a forfeit, you rate its difficulty. Finding it "easy" will slightly increase the challenge and tasks per day, while "hard" will scale it back. The system adapts to keep you challenged but not overwhelmed.
​✏️ Total Customization: You are the master of this game. Add, delete, and edit everything:
​The list of possible tasks and their point values.
​The rewards and their point costs.
​The components of your forfeits—tasks, positions, and base duration.
​💾 Persistent Local Storage: No account needed. All your settings, progress, and points are saved directly in your browser, ready for your next session.
